## Info

This project involved using the alphavantage.co RESTAPI to fetch all current exchange rates of fiat and cryptocurrencies.<br />
This project is far from finished. Only basic styling and alot of unused code. This was just to get me started with react, and
to focus simply on the functionality.<br />
I also needed a list of all fiat and crypto currencies.<br />
For the cryptocurrencies: https://github.com/crypti/cryptocurrencies <br />
For the fiatcurrencies: https://gist.github.com/joseluisq/59adf057a8e77f625e44e8328767a2a5 <br />
I modified the fiatcurrency json file by implementing a small python script. I've included the py script.
